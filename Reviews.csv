Max Express Courier Services llc,rajkumar nair,"We frequently use MAX Courier to send many parcel across the country, and I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience. From start to finish, their service was exceptional.

First and foremost, the process of booking our shipment is incredibly easy. Just give them a call, and the beauty is, they assign personal agents to take care of the customers, here my special mention is Ms Remya and Ms Sree Lakshmi, who handles our packages . And they are doing a great job. The pick up agents are very friendly..
Additionally, their pricing are very competitive.

Our shipments are always very fragile electronic equipment and i can easily vouch for them as a single package is not damaged any time.

Once my shipment was booked, I was kept well-informed throughout the entire process. I received regular updates on the status of my package, which gave me peace of mind knowing that it was on its way and everything was going smoothly.

Overall, I am so happy with the service that MAX Courier provides..Their easy booking process, competitive pricing, and exceptional delivery experience have made me a loyal customer. I highly recommend them to anyone in need of reliable and professional courier services.",5

Because they dont have a customer service, you call them they will refer you to the app which is chat bot: you try to call agent whom your courier is handed to, no response again. If you would like to speak with human being, call their customer service and select make a shippment then hopefully you can talk with a human. I dont know whether it works because i surrendered after waiting over 25 minutes on the call.

Aramex,Houda Cassim,"Subject: Unreliable Service and Lack of Communication from Aramex I am deeply disappointed with Aramex courier service for their blatant disregard of scheduled pickup times and abrupt cancellations without any prior notice. My recent experience has left me frustrated and inconvenienced, as the promised service timelines were not honored. Despite providing a specific time for shipment pickup, Aramex failed to adhere to the agreed-upon schedule. This lack of punctuality not only reflects poorly on their professionalism but also caused significant disruptions to my plans. Adding to the frustration, the shipment was canceled without any advance notification. This lack of communication is unacceptable and demonstrates a disregard for customer satisfaction. As a customer, I expect a certain level of reliability and courtesy, which unfortunately, Aramex failed to deliver. I hope this review serves as a warning to others considering Aramex for their courier needs.

I told him why did you tell me that I am not at home? He said, “No problem, I will come back tomorrow.” He asked him for a specific date. He told me that he did not have a specific date. He asked that I leave the shipment in front of the house for two days and did not do so. Come. The complainant tried to contact customer service, but all attempts failed and I was unable to reach them. I told myself to go to the nearest branch and deliver it yourself, but when I arrived, he told me that he could not receive it for my son, so I had to go to another large branch so that they could receive it.

They can’t deliver to my work as I sometimes have to leave it for meetings with a day’s notice and they can’t deliver it home as they can’t give less than half a day as a time slot. I used to give a 1 hour slot in central London when delivery whole vans of heavy boxes, but this delivery specialist is unable to specific what time they will come despite it only being a letter on the back of a motorbike. A motorbike which could easily deliver a takeaway in 10 minutes, but, because they’re a ‘courier’ they are incapable of giving a useful time frame. So we have to hunt for this moving kiosk.

Century Express Courier Service,Puya Hariri,"When I called on Wed the 4th Jan, they quoted me 25 AED for next day service. When the courier arrived to pick up the parcel he told me to pay him 30 AED. I should have known right there that this was a shoddy courier service. But I didn't go with my gut instinct and decided to give them a chance. When I asked why he wanted to charge me 5 AED more than I was quoted he just laughed but agreed to the 25 AED fee. The next day (Thursday) I called to check if my parcel was delivered. A girl answered and said that she didn't know cause the courier hadn't logged the delivery in to their system. She said she'd call me back. Instead she just went home. I called again and this time it was a guy who answered. He told me very calmly that they would deliver may package on Saturday instead (two day after it was supposed to be delivered). No apology, no expression of contrition, nothing. When I asked that I therefore want my package back he refused. Said they had no couriers (even though it was three hours before the end of business). I asked for the managers and he said ""he was not there"". I asked for the managers number but he had turned his phone off. I called back and had to threaten them before they finally agreed to send my package back to me. I could not trust them any more with my package, or the prospect of having it delivered even on Saturday and frankly I didn't want to contribute a single penny towards an unprofessional company that took it's customers for granted and didn't even want to notify me of the late delivery.

I called the customer service centre to request for delivery several times. The people that answer like robots without any empathy for the customer don’t solve the problem. 2 days back I finally made 4 calls to the Aramex call Centre as the delivery associate missed his delivery window of 9-2 pm. They assured me that the card would be delivered in the evening & lo and behold- when the delivery associate reaches in the evening his machine doesn’t work. I told the associate I had a flight the next day and this has already been delayed by 3 weeks, he called his team leader in the evening since Aramex was shut by then. The team leader was so rude, he didn’t accept responsibility & told me “we’ll ask the bank to cancel your card” despite all the delays, mistakes & machine errors from their side. The only saving Grace in the whole situation is the kind delivery man who came back the next morning to deliver my shipment. I got called by Aramex 4-5 times on the day of my flight as I had complained. It’s laughable that on the call they said “our delivery associate tried to reach you but you weren’t available.” This is despite me calling Aramex several times on Saturday & Monday.

I should have known right there that this was a shoddy courier service. But I didn't go with my gut instinct and decided to give them a chance. When I asked why he wanted to charge me 5 AED more than I was quoted he just laughed but agreed to the 25 AED fee. The next day (Thursday) I called to check if my parcel was delivered. A girl answered and said that she didn't know cause the courier hadn't logged the delivery in to their system. She said she'd call me back. Instead she just went home. I called again and this time it was a guy who answered. He told me very calmly that they would deliver may package on Saturday instead (two day after it was supposed to be delivered). No apology, no expression of contrition, nothing. When I asked that I therefore want my package back he refused. Said they had no couriers (even though it was three hours before the end of business). I asked for the managers and he said ""he was not there"". I asked for the managers number but he had turned his phone off. I called back and had to threaten them before they finally agreed to send my package back to me. I could not trust them any more with my package, or the prospect of having it delivered even on Saturday and frankly I didn't want to contribute a single penny towards an unprofessional company that took it's customers for granted and didn't even want to notify me of the late delivery.

Century Express Courier Service,Bella Pre-loved Boutique,"Just when I thought I booked with the right courier, I am now under stress. I booked online with the given pick up time and delivery time and date I made it 35min pick up time and 35min deli time As it is only Al Warqa-Karama and not rush hour. I chose the “same day delivery” which is today. Booking went through easily online. Courier called 25min min after the requested time to ask where pick up location is. I was surprised. 2.5hrs later, delivery still not received. Customer Service Hotline and whatsapp is extremely unreliable. After a couple of calls, courier finally answered and said he was only asked to pick up & he is a private courier that Century hires.....Shame... So he has no clue when my parcel will be delivered maybe morning maybe evening tomorrow. Thanks Century because that Parcel is URGENT. You should not accept same day if you cannot accommodate.

Century Express Courier Service,Manal Rauf,"Absolutely horrible, disappointing service. I am a small business owner and reached out to deliver a package to my client (from AD to Dubai). They assured me the package would be delivered in 2-3 business days. After 4 I reached out and kept getting told that ""tomorrow it would reach the client"" and alas, nothing. Not only did I waste 2 weeks calling and asking for repeated updates, my client was also frustrated waiting. After a week and a half of this annoyance, I asked to forget it and return the package to me, and even still, I waited day after day, being told that ""tomorrow it will be returned"". I was being told ""before 5pm on Monday"" and then ""definitely before 2pm on Tuesday"" until I called multiple times on Wednesday until I received it midday. The only positive is the customer service person who was patient - but even then I felt as if I was being scammed of my time and money. Not only did I have to go through such an annoying delivery experience, I also have a very unhappy, frustrated client who still hasn't gotten my product and will probably not rebuy because of such a hassle. They have resulted in me losing business and reputation. And when I got the package returned it was crushed. I will never be using this service again for such inappropriate lack of consideration and disappointing service, and I would urge others to find another alternative company.",1.0

UPS,Arwa Alajmi,"(Translated by Google) I ordered from a website on June 14, and the order sat with them for a long time on the basis of customs clearance. I called, but there was no response. After a long wait, I received the stolen order (the order box with the accessories is there), but the item for which I paid money was no.
I spoke to them and they told me verbatim (we deliver people’s belongings and don’t take them away) even though it is an expensive thing and money is paid for it and the possibility of it being stolen is high because it is gold and diamonds, by God, and I don’t care, as if I was talking to myself, even though I told them that there was a paste on the cardboard other than the site paste, and I took a picture for them after they contacted me, and nothing. In response, they numb me every time I insist on them, but without any result. I filed a complaint in this place and I continue to follow the matter, and they, by God, are not as if I complained. I mean, on top of that, they were late for me and the reason for stealing the order. However, they came to lie to me in the beginning, and after I contacted the site that I ordered from, they asked for pictures, they silenced me and the previous one. More than a month, knowing that I ordered from other delivery companies + orders coming from China in particular, and I received them in full without any shortage or delay. I ordered from this site before, but it was (a bag) not diamonds. The issue is upset, and whoever is upset is that the one who lost my money and the one who is harmed is me and I am tired and I will continue to demand. (In my right)
Until now, I am trying to call the number, but there is no response. Imagine
By the way, after I filed a complaint with information technology, they called me after, even if it was less than one star, I gave them a lot of stars.

UPS,Essam,"(Translated by Google) Unfortunately, although UPS is considered the largest shipping company in the world, its local agent is the worst agent in the world!! ..And it became clear to me that the parent company in America, headed by it, does not care about its customers in Saudi Arabia and does not consider their complaints.. (A complaint was sent and no response was received for two weeks.. I will try again, but this time I will contact the executive director) My problem is that the delivery date was canceled under the pretext that The customer did not respond.. and imagine that because I did not respond to the WhatsApp message due to delivery.. I was put in the system because I did not respond!! Look at a respectable shipping company in the whole world that communicates with its customers via WhatsApp?!!! Why don't you contact me by phone or SMS...like God's creation!! Who even allowed you to contact me on WhatsApp? WhatsApp is private, oh!!! The customer service is very, very bad.. and they did not solve the problem for me at the head of the supervisor.. and they did not even promise me to try to solve it or not to repeat it.. this is not to mention the exorbitant customs clearance fees.. I was discharged three times from customs and value-added tax.. which is possible for a Muslim We believe in God.. but why do you encourage me to clear it? And for a very high amount!! God suffices me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.. since they first opened.. and there has been no development, even though the other shipping companies, to be honest, have developed.. except for them.. from bad to worse!!!

( تم ارسال شكوى ولم يتم الرد من اسبوعين .. وسأحاول مرة اخرى ولكن هذه المرة  سأتواصل مع المدير التنفيدي )  مشكلتي هي انه تم الغاء موعد التوصيل بحجة ان العميل لم يتم الرد .. وتخيلوا انه بسبب انني لم ارد على رسالة واتساب بداعي التسليم .. تم وضعي في السيستم علي انني لم ارد !! شوفوا لي شركة شحن محترمة في العالم كله تتواصل مع عملائها عن طريق الواتساب ؟!!!  ليش ما تتواصل معي جوال او sms .. زي خلق الله !! مين اصلا سمح لك تتواصل معي واتساب  .. الواتساب له خصوصية ياهذا !!! خدمة العملاء سيئين جدا جدا .. ولم يحلوا لي المشكلة على رأسهم المشرف .. ولم يعدوني حتى بمحاولة حلها او عدم تكرارها .. هذا ناهيك عن رسوم التخليص الجمركي الباهظة .. تم تشريجي ثلاث مرات من الجمارك و ضريبة القيمة المضافة .. وهي ممكن مسلم بها امنا بالله .. بس ليه تشرجني على التخليص ؟ وبمبلغ باهظ جدا !!  حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل .. من اول مافتحوا .. وهم مافيه تطور مع ان شركات الشحن الثانية بالامانه تطورت ..الا هم .. من سئ  الى اسوأ !!!",1

To be honest, unfortunately, procrastination and not giving a consistent word is something that is invincible.

My package was for EXPRESS delivery, I PAID SO MUCH MORE for that, despite that being said, it was also put on PRIORITY list by amazon. Everyday since it came to Riyadh I call them 2-3 times just to make sure my package will be delivered and 5 people promised me that ""it will be delivered the following day"", Yousef, Ali, Mohammad, Mubakara and I forgot the other guy. I swear to God, they did nothing but lied.

1) They don't give you updates on your package, nor any valid reason it wasn't delivered (can you believe, one reason they gave me is because 'the driver didn't pick it up from the warehouse', another one is 'it's in a different warehouse' blah blah blah). Stupid reasons which are not even valid

2) They don't even apologize --- except for one guy, Mohammad

I don't know if they have a driver or something, or they're doing it on purpose so you'll end up picking up your package yourself. I mean, regardless of the priority status, they just don't care about their customers.

One guy I spoke to don't know where the pickup location is, and another guy Mubarak, is way too lazy to actually ask me to google the location myself.

It's frustrating especially for us ladies we cannot travel alone in Saudi Arabia --- see, they don't even care about the rules and laws of the country where they are working.

I end up google-ing the address and spending a LOT of money to pick up the parcel in their warehouse.

Go to Aramex or some other company, they will send you updates nonstop until you receive your package. UPS is a good company in other countries, but in Saudi Arabia? Forget it.

They said, “Your address is incomplete, even though my address is complete and there is nothing wrong with it.” And in this case, it was more than a week until I ran out and went to receive it from the warehouse in Sulay. And it wasted my time, and on top of that, the customer service is very bad. If you try to call them, they do not answer you. You have to call back more than once in Arabic. If you have a shipment, do not think about receiving it through them and do not ship it through them because you are being foolish.

FedEx Service Center - Dubai Internet City,S.Ahmed AlAli,"The customer service in FedEx middleeast is disturbingly horrific and terrible. LOCALS and ARABIC speakers are not welcome.

My father and I, had visited the FedEx office located in Bahrain ""Muharraq"" in order to ship a package. Upon arrival me and my father greeted the FedEx representative and were answered with silence and evil looks.

We both brushed it off and stayed friendly asking him for help with shipping the envelope, and again he looked at my father with disgust and ignored him. Giving him the benefit of the doubt assuming he might not speak Arabic or English, we asked if someone can help.

He again ignored both of us only giving us cold disturbing looks, it left me and my father both confused.
My father puzzled and with innocence tried talking to him again and was immediately answered with a rude ""WAIT"" and again looked at my dad like he was trash.

Confused as to why he was treating my father this way as my dad is an elderly man and is genuinely sweet and treats everyone as his grandkids.
When I tried to speak he rudely said ""GIVE ME YOUR ID"" giving the impression he's some sort of authority figure and that we are disturbing his peace.

My father took the envelope off the table and walked out, we went into the business next door an office called ""Safeway Express"" and were immediately welcomed in Arabic and English. Within minutes we were taken care of and our package was shipped.

My father called Fedex to complain and even though he picked the option in Arabic he was answered in English, He notified the representative on the phone that he would like to complain about the FedEx employee they immediately hung up the phone on him.

I called and was answered in the same manner, during my second call at attempting to cast my complaint I finally spoke to a representative who said that someone will call the guy and ask him what happend, and someone ""might"" call me back.

4 hours after that I called again and was told that there are no FedEx managers or representatives in Bahrain that will ever speak to a customer only Dubai call center will handle this matter and that they will ask the guy what happend. It's been nearly a month and no one has called or followed up with what had happened.",1
UPS,Sa Mj,"(Translated by Google) The worst shipping company for me. They call me for four days to deliver an order and it does not happen. I tried to call them many times on their phones, but no one answers the phones. A voice message was sent with no result.

You spend a lot of money trying to contact their hot line and you listen to long lecture about the greatness of the company before someone  bothers to answer the phone and most likely tell you that your parcel is on the way just to get rid of you.

Now the items have arrived in GHANA
And the custom officers are demanding 13,000 cedis for clearance when my profit is not even up to 2000 cedis!!!!
( just because there was diamonds in the package) They keep negotiating and the fact that they keep negotiating means the money is going straight to their pockets. WHEN I HAVE PAID FOR DUTY AND EVERYTHING IN DUBAI ALREADY

However recently, we have been doing shipments outside the UAE and the only person in charge (Hashir) is very stressful to deal with. He over billed us by weighing only one box and multiplied it by the 12 boxes we had to ship out. Good thing we checked before paying. Reported this and his very late responses to the manager (Fatima) but nothing.

I hope upper management be made aware bec the person handling the international shipping is really something else. Perhaps there should be more people in that area.

First Flight (Middle East) Qatar W.L.L,Kay El,"This is a honest review from myself, I thought it is only just to come here and share my experience with this courier. This is the 2nd Courier that Desert cart set me up with as their first one failed to delivery and delayed my package for almost 2 weeks.
 

 At first glance I was very disheartened because I came to check the reviews of first flight and the majority were very negative, I had an extremely anxious feeling that they will go through the same problem the first courier went through and that my package would get delayed again, I was ready to complain to desert cart and cancel my order + request for a refund.
 

 My experience with first flight however was extremely satisfying and smooth. As soon as it landed in DOHA, the same day it was out for delivery and reached my apartment within the after noon. The delivery driver and customer service team were very responsive and the communications were not delayed.
 

 First flight did not disappoint.",5

Pigeon Express Cargo Qatar,rony g Mathew,"I have send a sea cargo of 5 boxes around 165 kg with Pigeon Cargo Qatar on 23 May 2023. I have faced the below issues with them which I thought would be helpful for others as well as for Pigeon Cargo for their improvement;
 1) The commitment date for the cargo to reach Kerala was 60-70 days. That means it should have been reached by 2 Aug 2023.
 I received cargo on 17 Aug 2023 (15 more days). This is not a big issue but let everyone be prepared for 80-90 days and also the people who may send food items, please be sure about the expiry for those.
 2)The updates from the contact person at Qatar office was not satisfactory. Whenever we calls, he keeps saying it will reach in 10-15 days like a recorded voice.
 3)Another update that was given to me in July 2023 was that my cargo already reached Cochin and waiting for customs clearance but in first week of August 2023 when I called, they told me that the cargo is in Delhi waiting customs clearance. They told me that it was a mistake from their side & they had actually send my cargo via Delhi.
 4)We had given two contact numbers, one primary and other secondary in case if primary person not available. The pigeon team did not give the primary contact to the agent who delivered the items to door, so there was a lack of proper communication.
 5) The delivery agents (I forgot their service company name as they told that they don't belong to pigeon cargo) 2 people were there. Even before my father came to the road, they unloaded all the 5 boxes in the road itself in a rough manner. He came seeing all the boxes lying on the road. As the path to my home was a small way (only 50 meters long well enough for bikes & scooters to pass) they refused to carry it inside even though they were 2 persons. Their behavior to my parents and to me when I spoke to them over phone was not good. I told them that they can take it inside using my fathers scooter (Activa) but they were not even patient enough to listen to us. Anyhow they brought the boxes to the door on my fathers scooter only taking each box one by one.
 6)If its elderly people, ask your agents or delivery people to have little patience and nice way of talking.
 7)Finally, after opening the boxes, I found few items damaged & broken (Flask, Mixer grinder, Glasses, cups). The Pigeon team told that the service was including packing but their packing process is in hurry & improper manner so its better that we pack our valuables by ourselves in a good manner.
 8)Photos of the damaged items are posted.
 

 I can see that this is very lengthy but this may be helpful for others who send their valuables paying a good amount of money for not to end up in trouble. Also pigeon team please try to improve on the issues which happened with me.",3

Aramex,Madhu Koduganti,"In absence of regular postal service like in many countries, Aramex, Empost and few courier services fulfill the requirement quite efficiently. Known for their food service and coverage of entire country, including remote locations. Although they are fast and professional, they charge you a bomb. If you plan to send some package, first check for their rates. Bound to get shock. Very expensive. Unfortunately many services here in UAE are very expensive. So check for the rates before opting.",3

SMSA Express - Al Khobar Office,Azido Azzon,"(Translated by Google) The location is good and easily accessible. But it appears old and dusty. It needs cleaning internally and externally.
The problem with this company is that you give them a clear address and you receive your next packages from it once or twice. Then, if there is a package coming to you, you start logging in to their website to re-locate the delivery location, and after you specify your location, you get a call a day later to ask you to confirm the address.
Then, after all of this, the delivery representative calls you and begins giving you instructions on how to reach it, and not the other way around. Finally, you receive your packages somewhere on the street. This happens frequently but not every time.
Butter. It is better to specify one of their branches to receive the package than to wait for the shipment to arrive to you.

الموقع جيد ويمكن الوصول اليه بسهولة. لكن يظهر عليه القدم والغبار. يحتاج للتنظيف داخليا وخارجيا.
مشكلة هذه الشركة انك تعطيهم عنوان واضح وتستلم عليه طرودك القادمة مرة او مرتين وبعد ذلك في حال وجود طرد قادم لك تبدا المسجات للدخول على موقعهم في الانترنت لاعادة تحديد مكان التسليم وبعد ان تحدد مكانك ياتيك اتصال بعدها بيوم ليسالك عن تاكيد العنوان.
ثم بعد هذا كله يتصل عليك مندوب التسليم ويبدا باعطائك تعليمات كيفية الوصول اليه وليس العكس. وفي النهاية تستلم طرودك في مكان ما بالشارع. هذا يحدث بشكل متكرر وليس كل مرة.

Aramex,Amirhossein Hemmatyar,"I'm not complaining about the staff but the whole concept of verification and handover.

I have recently established my company in Dubai as an expat, I have opened a bank account and here, Aramex is the courier for bank delivery by default.

So today I was notified my debit card and cheque book were ready to collect from an Aramex outlet. I walked a long distance only to know that they need Emirates ID to give me my package.

I have a flight tomorrow morning to my hometown and will not be here for another month and I REALLY REALLY needed my debit card for my next trip.

It's been 6 days now I've been waiting for my Emirates ID card to come but it just won't and I had my passport, shipment number, residency sticker, their SMS and I look perfectly like my passport photo but they don't accept anything but the Emirates ID card. This is far from flexible

Things can be done faster atleast when there is a rush and the place is a walkway a bit congested and many people can't queue up there at a time.

Aymakan Warehouse,Ahmed Ahmed,"(Translated by Google) After many experiences of buying from online stores, I seemed to be convinced that if the store and the delivery company do not have the option of paying on delivery ((You see them throwing money at you because they took their money and you got involved), you do not have the right to withdraw from them because you paid, and you do not have the right to cancel and get your dirhams back, as for me now, if you do not get the payment on delivery service. What I ask them and send them is that I backed out of the purchase due to not providing the payment option upon receipt)) If we all join hands and put pressure on them, you will see how the service improves, and the delivery companies are racing against time for the shipment to arrive on time or even before, so that the customer does not withdraw from them and lose the value of the delivery and return the shipment to the store.

 أنا بعد تجارب عديدة لشراء من المتاجر الإلكترونية بدت تتكون عندي قناعة أن المتجر وشركة التوصيل اذا ماكان عندهم خيار الدفع عند الإستلام ((تراهم بيمرمطونك لأنهم أخذو فلوسهم وأنت تورطت لايمديك تسحب عليهم لأنك دفعت ولايمديك تلغي وتسترجع دراهمك بالنسبة لي حاليا إذا ماحصلت خدمة الدفع عند الإستلام ماأطلب منهم وأرسلهم أني تراجعت عن الشراء بسبب عدم توفير خيار الدفع عند الإستلام )) لو كلنا نتكاتف ونضغط عليهم بتشوفون وشلون الخدمة بتتحسن وشركات التوصيل تسابق الزمن لوصول الشحنة بوقتها أو حتى قبل عشان العميل لايسحب عليهم ويخسرون قيمة التوصيل وإرجاع الشحنة للمتجر",2

Aramex,MUHAMMED ALI WAYANAD,I requested one return shipment on 27th December but till 8th January no one contacted for pick up. I raised my concern through phone many times still no response,2
Aramex,Denis Lebedev,"Literally the worst shipping company I’ve ever seen. I recommend to keep away from them unless you don’t have other options.
 

 But if you have chosen them, be prepared to overpriced service, missed deliveries, long waiting at the pickup points, no customer support at all. Even their web-site is buggy. Note the typical answers from them here like “email us to …” and other blah-blah-blah with zero help.
 

 The delivery address which you will put in a delivery request form very likely will differ from the actual delivery address where they will try to deliver and you’ll get missing delivery. A driver will not contact you and the only thing you will see is “delivery attempt” in the tracking form. Where the “delivery attempt” happened and why you hadn’t been contacted you won’t know. And the support won’t help you, because there is no support. Sure, there is a web support form but it is useless.
 

 STAY AWAY if there are other options.",2
Aramex,yousef Abdullah,The service is really unacceptable only one person work and very slow need to add more personal to provide faster service,2

DHL Service Point (Airport Road),Sushma,- There was no machine to take numbers staff was just calling ppl randomly as he said he remembers however when my turn came instead of calling me he called another man who was kind enough to tell him it's my turn before him. It's quite expensive as well.,2

Aramex,René Van Niekerk,"Very frustrating dealing with this company. I got a text to say my shipment was out for delivery. The guy calls me to confirm my address at 1pm. I told him I am not home and he should leave it at the reception desk. After 2pm I check the status, and it suddenly says that the delivery must be rescheduled to following business day. I find this extremely unprofessional as there is no reason cited for this, and the driver could have called me again if there was a problem. There is no customer service number listed, and I had to trick the system to actually speak to a person. She could not tell me where exactly my package was or whether I would be able to collect it on the same day. Now it's after 6pm and their offices are closed. It's absolutely ridiculous and I hope I never have to deal with them again.",1
Aramex,Ibrahim Al-Haidos,"The worse courier service I have dealt with ever. They never answer phone calls and there is always an answer machines that hangs up on you without even recording any messages, nor call you back. The tracking on the App and website is not real - time, so the tracking number that you have is useless for tracking. I went my self to the branch in the afternoon to know the status of my shipment and it was actually with the driver. After the agent called the driver he said that he called me 3 times ( not true ) because I have my phone in my hand all day waiting for the shipment. I actually called the driver in the morning (because I have his number as he is responsible to deliver to my area for years) he told me that he is off. Then they told me that the shipment will be delivered the next day between 9 am to 3 pm . And here I am at 3:36 pm now and the package didn’t arrive, and I have no one to call except the driver who constantly tells me I’ll come after 30 mins. And there is no way to complain since there are 2 contact numbers only with an answer machine. And I am going to miss the event that I am going to or go without a present !",1
Aramex,Husam Nurein,"If I can give them a 0 or less stars I would,
 I always avoid using their services by all costs, even if I have to pay more with another company, unless it's my only option,
 their phone customer service is the most frustrating experience ever 😡,",1
